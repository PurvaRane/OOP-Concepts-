# OOP-Concepts-
College Practice

This repository contains basic programs demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as:

- Classes & Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Constructors and Destructors

These examples were created during my college learning to strengthen understanding of OOP using **Java**, **C++**, and **Python**. Each concept is explained with a simple and readable code snippet, ideal for revision or beginners.
